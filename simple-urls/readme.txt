Simple URLs helps you to manage links, create product displays, and grow your affiliate marketing business.

== Description ==

Simple URLs helps you manage and organize links directly inside WordPress. It’s useful for affiliate marketers, bloggers, and anyone who wants more control over outbound links.

### What you can do with Simple URLs

* Create short, clean URLs with custom slugs  
* Cloak affiliate links with optional attributes (new window, nofollow, sponsored)  
* Organize and edit links from a central dashboard  
* Insert links from the editor while writing posts  
* Track basic click counts on your links  
* Works with both the Block Editor and Classic Editor  

### Why it’s helpful

With Simple URLs, you don’t need spreadsheets to keep track of affiliate links. Update a link once in your dashboard, and it’s automatically updated everywhere it’s used on your site.  

When writing new content, you can quickly search for a link in the editor and insert it without leaving the page. This helps keep your workflow smooth and lets you stay focused on creating content.  

### Getting started

1. Install and activate Simple URLs.  
2. Go to **Simple URLs → Add New**.  
3. Enter the destination URL, slug, and any attributes.  
4. Save your link and insert it into posts or pages.  

That’s all there is to it — manage as many links as you need, all in one place.
